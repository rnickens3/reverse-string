# reverse-string
Uses three methods: split, reverse, and join, to reverse any string.

## How It Works
* Split: this will break a string into individual characters in an array. These are also called substrings.
* Reverse: this reverses the characters split above. It reverses the order of an array.
* Join: this joins the characters in an array into a single string. By leaving this blank, there will be nothing separating the characters.
